## Project Overview

### Second-Hand Trading Platform (Group G)

*With AI One-Click Listing and Interest-Based Homepage Recommendation*

This project is a web-based second-hand trading platform that supports the main user and administrator workflows in a realistic marketplace setting. Visitors can browse listings, search products, apply filters, and view item details before signing in. Registered users can then create listings, save interesting items, submit purchase requests, track request history, complete transactions, and leave reviews. A standard user account can act as both buyer and seller through different actions in the system, while administrators manage platform operations.

The project also draws on a review of mainstream second-hand trading platforms in New Zealand, especially Trade Me. That review highlighted two practical gaps:
- Trade Me still uses a traditional multi-step listing flow in which users must manually fill in all fields before publishing an item. 
- Trade Me tends to show relatively fixed and general homepage content to different users

In response, our project focuses on two highlighted features that are practical and clearly differentiated from a standard marketplace flow:

- `AI One-Click Listing Assistant`
  - helps users generate a draft listing from a product photo instead of manually filling every field from scratch
- `Interest-Based Homepage Recommendation`
  - makes homepage discovery more relevant to a user's recent interest instead of showing similar fixed homepage content to different users

The project will also be deployed as a live containerised system and refined through user testing.

## Agile Approach

This project follows a lightweight six-week Agile workflow suitable for a two-member team.

The team will work in short sprints, review progress regularly, and adjust tasks based on implementation progress. The workflow focuses on:

- delivering a working MVP early
- improving the system by sprint iteration
- keeping the scope realistic
- sharing work equally across the team
- testing and refining the system continuously

Each sprint is expected to deliver a testable and reviewable increment so the system can improve through continuous sprint iteration.

## Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Implementation Approach | Verification Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFR-1 | The system shall load core pages within 3 seconds under normal local demo conditions. | Keep Flask routes lightweight, use efficient SQL queries, limit unnecessary data loading, and keep uploaded images reasonably sized. | Measure response times for `/login`, `/register`, `/listings`, and `/listings/<id>` using browser developer tools. |
| NFR-2 | The system shall store passwords only as hashed values and shall never store passwords in plain text. | Use password hashing during registration and hash verification during login. Store only `password_hash` in the database. | Inspect the authentication code and confirm the database stores hashed values instead of readable passwords. |
| NFR-3 | The system shall require authentication for protected actions and prevent unauthorized access to private operations. | Apply login protection to actions such as creating listings, saving favorites, editing profiles, and submitting requests. Check ownership before allowing listing edits or deletion. | Attempt protected actions while logged out and confirm redirection to the login page. Attempt editing another user's listing and confirm access is denied. |
| NFR-4 | The system shall handle invalid or incomplete input without crashing and shall return a clear error message to the user. | Perform server-side validation for registration, login, and listing forms. Re-render the page with validation feedback when submission fails. | Submit incomplete or invalid forms and confirm the system shows an error message instead of returning a server error. |
| NFR-5 | The database shall maintain referential integrity between users, listings, categories, requests, reviews, and favorites. | Define foreign key relationships in the schema and validate related records before saving business data. | Review the schema and confirm valid foreign key definitions. Test that invalid references are not accepted through normal workflows. |
| NFR-6 | Public pages such as listings and item detail pages shall remain accessible without login whenever the application server is running. | Keep public browse and detail routes outside authentication protection and ensure missing optional data is handled gracefully. | Access `/listings` and `/listings/<id>` while logged out and confirm both pages load successfully. |
| NFR-7 | The system shall function correctly in at least two modern desktop browsers used for project demonstration. | Use standard HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Flask templates without browser-specific dependencies. | Test key workflows in at least two browsers, such as Chrome and Edge, and confirm that navigation, forms, and page rendering work correctly. |
| NFR-8 | The codebase shall be organized into separate modules for routes, services, models, templates, and static assets to support team collaboration and maintenance. | Keep the current layered project structure and place business logic in the service layer instead of mixing it into templates or route handlers. | Review the project structure and confirm new features follow the same separation of concerns. |
| NFR-9 | The project shall provide a documented way to recreate the database schema and restore required demo data after local data loss. | Maintain an initialization script and a shared demo database or repeatable seed process. Document the recovery steps clearly. | Rebuild the schema from scratch and confirm that required demo users, listings, and related records can be restored successfully. |
